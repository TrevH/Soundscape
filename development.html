    <p class="abstract_content border font-italic font-weight-light  border-left-0 border-top-0 border-bottom-0">Our development process really started with our inspirations, setting the direction for the project.  We worked closely with the UQ iPad ensemble to understand how they worked with the iPad and exploring how an interface such as Soundscape should work for them.  This section is a brief summary of the design and development process we undertook for the project.</p>

        <h5>Initial Prototype</h5>
        <p>The starting point for this project was to carry on where SoundGarden had finished.  The The first stage was to observe the ensemble during their weekly practices working on the iPads.  From these observations, we developed a prototype using a cardboard box, stretch fabric and a single flex sensor. Despite having very limited functionality, it enabled us to explore with people whether these would support the interaction that we had envisioned.  This prototype used the data from flex sensors via an arduino and, using max, allowed us to connect that data to Ableton.  This limited functionality allowed the ensemble to provide preliminary feedback about the interface.</p>

        <p>We considered using Kinect, the sensor that projects such as MozART and Fire & Ice had used.  We elected not to use Kinect due to ceasing of support by Microsoft for Kinect and simply to explore a different mechanism to base the interaction on.  Conductive cloth was also explored however we preferred to retain an interface based on stretch fabric due to it's translucence enabling rear projection onto it.</p>

        <h5>Testing</h5>
        <p>A further, more durable prototype was developed comprising a small wooden frame with three flex sensors underneath stretchable fabric. This also allowed us to start projecting visuals onto the cloth.  These visuals (generated in Unity) were responsive to the sound using a microphone placed next to a speaker.  We used this prototype as a platform for testing with the iPad Ensemble.  Their feedback was that touching and stretching the fabric was appealing.  Further, they liked the visuals.</p>

        <p>We also tested the prototype with members of the public at a small showcase of technology.  This provided us with valuable feedback of how non-musicians or musicians with experience only with traditional instruments felt about the interface and the interaction.  Most found the prototype intriguing, particularly using the interaction of pushing against fabric to change the music.</p>

        <h5>The current prototype</h5>
        <p>The current prototype was constructed again using wood and stretch fabric.  The main purpose of this prototype was to allow the iPad ensemble to use it for a performance as part of their assessment.  They used this prototype to practice and construct their performance.  A key constraint was that the prototype had to be capable of being removed from the performance venue within 10 minutes.  This constraint shaped a lot of it's design.</p>
        
        <p>Four separate panels made of wood and fabric were constructed.  They were 1.8m tall and 1m wide, sufficient for a single person to work with.  A modular floor was constructed that enabled the panels to be securely anchored without requiring any external support or anchoring.  They were arranged to form a single screen that was slightly concave.  This was to maintain a connection between the musicians so that they could provide cues to each other during performance.  Rear projector stands were constructed incorporating convex mirrors to help map the projection onto the screens as their positioning did not provide a completely flat surface for the projection.  The projector stands also helped position the projectors as they were removed for transport.</p>

        <p>Observing the ensemble practice with the prototype was a valuable source of information.  We found we had to provide some base information to them about what each sensor controlled and how they changed the music.  One of the ensemble members had created the music and we found that some changes were required to make the music 'fit' with the interactions that were possible.  To some extent this was a little disappointing as we had hoped that they would simple explore the interface and then construct music.  It seemed, however, that the fact that the performance was for assessment, the ensemble members wanted to be certain of what they were doing and to enssure that the performance was repeatable.</p>
        
        <p>After this initial information was provided, we found that the ensemble members quickly understood the mechanics of the interaction and then were able to construct their performance in a short period of time.  Again, the process they followed and how they were able to adjust the way they interacted to produce their composition and performance were valuable sources of information that will be used in the future.</p>
