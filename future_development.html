    <p class="abstract_content border font-italic font-weight-light  border-left-0 border-top-0 border-bottom-0">The current iteration of Soundscape is just a prototype.  People's comments and our observations of them interacting with Soundscape have given us many possibilities for it's future development.  Again, we find we need to start with people.</p>

        <p>Many people have enjoyed the experience of interacting with Soundscape. We have had varied responses where people love the hypnotic effect and the soft therapeutic sensation it has when touching the screens.</p>

        <blockquote class="blockquote text-right text-small-90 text-muted">
            <p class="mb-0">“I feel like a kitten . . purring and pawing as I am being patted”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote class="blockquote text-right text-small-90 text-muted">
            <p class="mb-0">“I could sit here all day as it is so calming”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>There also has been a considerable number of questions that were raised about the feedback people received and the type of interactions they expected. Our observations show that many people a wary of interacting with the surfaces. This could be a combination of not wanting to break the screens or that it doesn’t react as simultaneously as they would expect it to. This feedback is important to taking this project further.</p>

        <p>The creation of the music thus far is based on loops and using Ableton it has a method of quantizing so that the music will change to fall in line with the first beat of each bar. This was essential for the iPad ensemble who were performing their own composition. This is also useful for any novice musician - still wanting to have the end goal of creating a logical music performance. Then what is a logical music performance in this twenty first century.</p>

        <p>In the development of the music, we will endeavour to create a more spontaneous interaction. A touch of the screen will create a sound that is instantaneous in its feedback. Ableton allows the quantisation to be turned off will allow the performer to make individual interactions that generate sound. Moving away from using loops will allow the performers to manipulate that sounds to create an open-ended approach employing improvisation as in Jazz or Avant garde genres.</p>

        <p>Watching people tap the screens gave the impression they wanted the screen to be responsive similar to the instruments they were replicating - percussionists would tap on the screen (and sometimes quite violently) to produce the drum or rattle sound inspires the search to make the screens more responsive to multiple touches and various types of gestures.</p>

        <p>A similar aspect was seen in the visuals where it was expected to have the creation of a visual as soon as you touch as opposed the changing of a visual that was already existing on the screen. The people who interacted with the screens felt there wasn’t enough change to show their interaction and they wanted their gestures to manipulate the music and the visuals. This hasn’t been able to be produced using the sensors but it is possible that future developments may combine existing technology and an Intel RealSense camera.</p>

        <p>Feedback has shown that people want to be in control of the creation of their music on the screens whether it is planned and learned interaction or even if it is incidental.</p>

              <p class=" text-right text-muted">“Mizaru, Kikazaru, Iwazaru” , a common phrase which translates to speak see no evil, speak no evil and hear no evil is a performance inclusive of both dance and music to express death and its perceptions by people. The performance entailed music and dance. The music created utilized two interfaces that were made up out of stretchable fabric where performers utilized it to gesture around and produce sound in addition to the visualizations creatively being used to depict different phases of death.</p>
