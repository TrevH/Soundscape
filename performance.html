    <p class="abstract_content border font-italic font-weight-light  border-left-0 border-top-0 border-bottom-0">The utimate aim for us was to develop a prototype.  But, for the members of the iPad ensemble, the final objective was to perform a piece of music using Soundscape as part of their course assessment.  We felt the pressure to deliver.</p>

        <h5>Rehearsal</h5>
        <p>The iPad were a strong part of the development of Soundscape and our goal was to provide the interactions they wanted - interactions that although weren’t the same as those on the iPad but were able to provide the same result.</p>

        <p>With all interactions with a new interface there is a certain amount of learning that is involved. The Ensemble came to the workshop the week prior to the performance to play on Soundscape. They wanted to explore the surfaces to find the interactions they had to perform to change the effects that replicated those in Ableton. After a little fun experimenting with different sounds it didn’t take long to make music. These performers had knowledge of basic compositional devices to form a composition that had the basic elements of music, made sense and sounded good. One more rehearsal and there were even more chances to explore and improvise on their initial thoughts of the composition.</p>

        <h5>Performance</h5>
        <p>The performance was as usual a nervous situation. Performing at a concert on a traditional instrument could involve hours of practice and rehearsal. With only a few rehearsals, but confident, they jumped into the performance and with confidence performed an excellent performance. The ability to communicate throughout the performance kept organisation and harmony and even allowed a certain amount of improvisation to occur.</p>

        <p>After a well-received performance, the members of the iPad ensemble were pleased with the collaboration and were willing to perform again as well as gladly willing to provide valuable feedback to iterate further.</p>

        <p>A full video of the ensemble's performance is available in our gallery.</p>
