        <p>The interface is designed to allow them to perform their compositions and transport the interactive surface from a small iPad in front of them to a large visual display. The surface not only providing the digital musician with feedback of their interaction but also providing the audience with a similar experience and visual representation of the music.</p>

        <p>Soundscape is a prototype.  We are continuing to explore the possibilities of both context and functionality.  It's a bit big, a bit too heavy and uses too many cables.  But it's also a tool that helps give us people's views on how they might like to create music.</p>

        <h4>Inspirations</h4>
        <p>Performances are art forms of expressing human emotions in different ways. Sometimes, they are showcased in the form of a dance by using body movements as means and sometimes in the forms of expressing it through music. There have been many amazing projects and installations that have inspired us as we created Soundscape. The following are just a few of those projects that had an influence on the design and development of SoundScape.</p>

        <h5>MozART</h5>
        <p>MozART is an interactive installation developed to create music by using Spandex as a medium to create music. MozART was created for the 2016 iPad Ensemble for their coursework at the University of Queensland. The purpose of this installation was to push against the cloth with two hands to generate sound to showcase newer forms of musical interfaces. Mozart’s goal was to create an experience for people with or without musical backgrounds to create an exploratory experience of music creation.</p>

        <h5>Cinimod - Fire & Ice</h5>
        <p>The Fire & Ice installation was launched by Cinimod, a company that specialized in producing interactive light installations and interactive lighting. The installation used interactions, in terms of people’s arm movement, as a basis to generate new and unique visualizations depending upon people’s arm movements. Fire & Ice produced two distinct colors of visualizations depicting the red of ‘fire’ and the blue of ‘ice’. Two people can each choose ‘fire’ and ‘ice’ respectively and use the visuals as means to compete against each other.</p>

        <h5>SoundGarden</h5>
        <p>SoundGarden is an interactive installation that enables people with no musical background to create music with the use of gestures as means produce music. SoundGarden was created as a part of the Interaction Design coursework in the University of Queensland in 2017. The interface itself was made by stretchable material that enabled people to gesture around the material to produce a number of combinations of sounds.</p>

        <p>The installation entailed a total of 4 sails, each sail representing a component of music, that of melody, harmony, lead and percussion respectively. The nature of the installation allowed people to slide their arms, around each sail to manipulate musical loops. Each sail enables people to push the cloth and move their arms around the cloth to manipulate the loops. Each sail encompassed a different visualization that is synonymous to their individual component to create an association between the instrument, visual and the loops created. At the entrance to the installation, foot pads were present to select the genre of music.</p>
